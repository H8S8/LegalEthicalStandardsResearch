# Legal and Ethical Standards Reseach Task

## Scenario 1: BankingCorp

- Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?</br>

Yes, they have broken the GDPR by giving the loan company access to their system without first obtaining consent from the customers to have their data processed in this way.

- What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?</br>

Yes, in two ways. First, the way they are informing customers of the change is quite underhanded, many people may not have the time to read through the changes to the terms and conditions. Ultimately, if the loan company has had so much negative publicity that BankingCorp do not want to publicise their partnership, they shouldn't create the partnership. Second, the software the loan company plan to deploy is incredibly predatory. It targets people who are already faceing financial issues to lure them into almost certainly worsening their situation.

- What could the company do to address these issues?</br>

The company could just not carry through with this partnership. It is of no benefit to the customers. They may need to come clean about the data they shared with a third party without permission though?


## Scenario 2: Treasure Hunters

- Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?</br>

Not breaking any laws as far as I can tell!

- What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?</br>

I don't think this is too bad, I think purchasable hints are fairly ethical, the developers need to make money somehow? I like that you don't need to pay to unlock other parts of the map, though the completion of other parts to achieve this may entice impatient people into buying hints. I guess the main problem is that if you are well and truly stuck on a level and can't unlock the next map without purchasing a hint this could cause some individuals (possibly children) to spend a fair amount of money.

- What could the company do to address these issues?</br>

I don't think this is too much of an issue. But there could be an option to watch an ad to recieve a hint. This way there is a free option to recieve a hint and the developers still recieve funding through advertisements.


## Scenario 3: friends.com

- Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?</br>

The only possible legal issue I can spot is the fact that the users' location data will be shared with third parties with (what appears to be) no consent from the users.

- What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?</br>

I have a few concerns:</br>

There doesn't appear to be an age limit on the use of this app. There should definately be an 18+ age limit given users will have access to other users locations.</br>
I don't think location information should be any more specific than what county / city someone is living in to mitigate possible stalking or harrassment (this applies to premium users as well).<br>
I am a little skeptical about people being able to view others profiles without being matched by interests and location. I think users data should be presented as sparingly as possible while still maintaining the functionality / purpose of the app.

- What could the company do to address these issues?</br>

I think there should at least be a popup allowing the user to opt out of location specific ads. Location information stored on the app should not be very specific. There should be an 18+ age limit on the app.
